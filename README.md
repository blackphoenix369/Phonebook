# Phonebook
The given C++ code implements a basic console-based Contact Saver application that allows users to add and search for contact details. It uses file handling through the `<fstream>` library to store and retrieve contact information in a text file named `number.txt`. The program is menu-driven and provides four main options: Add Contact, Search Contact, Help, and Exit. When adding a contact, the user is prompted to enter their first name, last name, and a phone number. The program then checks whether the phone number is exactly 10 digits long and contains only numeric characters. If the validation passes, the contact is saved to the file.

The search functionality allows users to look up a contact by either first or last name. It reads through the file and displays the contact information if a match is found. The help option is currently a placeholder that pauses and clears the screen, while the exit option terminates the program with a thank you message.

The code uses global variables to store contact details temporarily, which simplifies access across functions but is not a good practice for larger applications. Input validation is handled using helper functions: `check_digits` to verify length and `check_numbers` to ensure only digits are entered. However, the program relies heavily on system-specific commands like `system("cls")`, `system("pause")`, and `system("color 0A")`, making it platform-dependent and suitable only for Windows environments. Additionally, there is no functionality to edit or delete contacts, and input is taken directly without any error handling, which can lead to potential issues.

Overall, this Contact Saver program demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and file I/O in C++. It is a suitable beginner-level project but would benefit from improvements in portability, code structure, and user input handling.
