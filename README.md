# Phonebook
The given C++ code is a simple console-based Contact Saver program that allows users to add and search contacts using file handling. It saves contact details (first name, last name, phone number) in a text file after validating that the phone number is exactly 10 digits and numeric. The program also includes basic options for help and exit. It uses global variables and Windows-specific commands like `system("cls")` and `system("pause")`, making it platform-dependent. While functional, the code lacks features like contact deletion or editing and could be improved with better input handling and code structure.
